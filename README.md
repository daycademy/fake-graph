# ðŸ”¨ Fake Graph

Fake Graph is a useful GraphQL test server, where you can test all GraphQL concepts (e.g. fragments, inline fragments). It is written in Type-GraphQL and has a SQLite database.

_More descriptive readme coming soon_

## Development

First of all, you need to clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:daycademy/fake-graph.git
$ cd ./fake-graph

$ npm install
OR
$ yarn
```

After that you can run the fake-graph GraphQL server.

```sh
$ npm run start
OR
$ yarn start
```

Now that is all to set up. You are now ready to go and send requests to `http://localhost:4000`
